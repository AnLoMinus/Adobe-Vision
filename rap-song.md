# Adobe All-Stars (Rap for HacKing-DJ)

**Hook**  
Creative Cloud in my veins, every byte is a beat,  
Punchlines pack the punch like Premiere on repeat,  
Photoshop the frame, Illustrator with the heat,  
Adobe in the building, HacKing-DJ on the seat.

**Verse 1**  
I open up Photoshop, mask off doubt like a pro,  
Liquify the limits, let the raw colors flow,  
Smart Objects on deck, every layer got a glow,  
Healing brush the scars, now the concept feelin' whole.  
Lightroom on the tone, calibrate a golden hour,  
Histogram flexin', shadows rising to the power,  
Sync it to the cloud, presets lined like a tower,  
Metadata in the mix, geotag the creative flower.  
Bridge it through Behance, portfolio on the throne,  
Every shot a billboard, every pixel set in stone.  
Punchline loaded heavier than 32-bit chrome,  
Export with a crunch like a snare, then I'm gone.

**Hook**  
Creative Cloud in my veins, every byte is a beat,  
Punchlines pack the punch like Premiere on repeat,  
Photoshop the frame, Illustrator with the heat,  
Adobe in the building, HacKing-DJ on the seat.

**Verse 2**  
Illustrator vector talk, pen tool sharp as a fang,  
Anchor points jumpin' like the crowd when the speakers bang,  
Gradient mesh meltin', typography in slang,  
Pathfinder slice the silence, let the megaphone rang.  
InDesign the spread, baseline grid with the swag,  
Master page magic, folio never lags,  
Variable data drip, QR codes in the bag,  
Preflight check clean like a tag on a rag.  
XD with the prototype, flows click in a loop,  
Voice triggers talk back, UI drippin' with the soup,  
Auto-animate slides, micro-interactions swoop,  
Punchlines dropping vectors, that's a scalable troupe.

**Hook**  
Creative Cloud in my veins, every byte is a beat,  
Punchlines pack the punch like Premiere on repeat,  
Photoshop the frame, Illustrator with the heat,  
Adobe in the building, HacKing-DJ on the seat.

**Verse 3**  
Premiere on the timeline, cuts razor like a chef,  
Lumetri on the color, grade deeper than the clef,  
Warp stabilize the steps so the chase never left,  
Essential Sound breathin', mix crisp, nothing deaf.  
After Effects portals, motion graphics take flight,  
Expression-laced lyrics, keyframes blink in the night,  
Cinema 4D lite, extrude dreams in the light,  
Render queue stompin', CPU in a fight.  
Audition on the vocal, de-noise haters off the map,  
Multiband comp’ hit, let the waveform clap,  
Media Encoder hustles, exports overlap,  
Every format get a punchline souvenir stamp.

**Bridge**  
Stock crate loaded with textures and flames,  
Acrobat locked down signatures and claims,  
Firefly sparkin' prompts that ignite new domains,  
Sensei in the backend, AI tamer of chains.  
We're pushing raw ideas into universal fame,  
Creative Cloud the cipher, Adobe carved in the name.

**Hook (Outro)**  
Creative Cloud in my veins, every byte is a beat,  
Punchlines pack the punch like Premiere on repeat,  
Photoshop the frame, Illustrator with the heat,  
Adobe in the building, HacKing-DJ on the seat.

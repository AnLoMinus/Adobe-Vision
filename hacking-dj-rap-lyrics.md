# "Adobe All-Star" — HacKing-DJ Anthem (English)

*Length: ~2,900 characters; ready for performance and recording on the HacKing-DJ channel.*

**Hook**
Adobe light in my DNA, shaders in my veins,
Photoshop the skyline, bending colors, warping frames,
Illustrator vectors snap—precision in my lanes,
Premiere keeps the tempo, every cut is clean and sane.

**Verse 1 — Creative Cloud Roll Call**
Spark from the lobby, I log in, keys ignite the thrusters,
Creative Cloud be the shuttle, guiding all the hustlers.
Photoshop liquify, skies drip like neon rain,
Content-Aware erases doubt, clears a master lane.
Lightroom in the backroom, tone curves like synth waves,
Catalog the memories, expose the inner brave.
Illustrator pen tool drawing halos over bars,
Bezier dreams orbit tight like satellites and stars.

**Pre-Chorus**
Bridge to the raw files, stacking layers of belief,
Gradient map my feelings, color theory for relief.
Every plug-in like percussion, every brush a drumline,
Adobe is the metronome that keeps my story on time.

**Verse 2 — Motion & Sound**
Premiere Pro splice a timeline, I’m riding on the rail,
Proxy files sprinting fast—delivery never stale.
After Effects particles, logo bursts like nova flares,
MoGraph on a mission, kinetic letters climb the stairs.
Audition scrubs the static, smooth vocal armor,
De-ess the hiss, pan the bliss, chorus sounding warmer.
Media Encoder on standby, batch like a chef,
Export in HDR, no compression on the flex.

**Hook**
Adobe light in my DNA, shaders in my veins,
Photoshop the skyline, bending colors, warping frames,
Illustrator vectors snap—precision in my lanes,
Premiere keeps the tempo, every cut is clean and sane.

**Verse 3 — 3D & Express**
Substance paint the armor, textures like a myth,
Smart materials singing chrome, sci-fi in a glyph.
Dimension builds the mock-up, product shots on fire,
Stager light the studio, reflections never tire.
Express on the mobile, templates in a flash,
Social posts in seconds, thumbnails that crash the dash.
Firefly conjures prompts, words morph into clay,
Text-to-image conjurations feed the render bay.

**Bridge — HacKing-DJ Signature**
HolyTrap in the headphones, cyber sparks in my chest,
AnLoMinus on the faders, HacKing-DJ doing reps.
Sample packs in folders labeled "Adobe Gives Me Lift",
Logo glowing crimson when the kick and snare shift.

**Verse 4 — Brand Love & Punchlines**
License on my wishlist? Adobe said, "We got you,"—facts.
Creative Suite a parachute when deadlines do attacks.
Fonts from Adobe Stock, kerning tighter than my crew,
Behance portfolio shining like a neon city view.
XD to Figma? Nah, I prototype with ease,
Interactive flows glide smoother than a breeze.
Cloud docs synced, no fear of data loss,
Version history saved me like a crossfade toss.

**Hook (Finale)**
Adobe light in my DNA, shaders in my veins,
Photoshop the skyline, bending colors, warping frames,
Illustrator vectors snap—precision in my lanes,
Premiere keeps the tempo, every cut is clean and sane.

**Outro**
If creativity’s a kingdom, Adobe owns the crown,
HacKing-DJ on the towers, sending thunder through the town.
Sponsor of the vision, partnership in flight,
Together we’re the future—bring the spark into the light.

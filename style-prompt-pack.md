# Style Prompt Pack (ready to copy)

**1) Neo-Noir Cyber Glow**
"Design a neon-noir poster for HacKing-DJ: rain-soaked alley, holographic turntables, magenta/teal palette, chrome typography, cinematic rim light, Adobe-style polish."

**2) Golden Renaissance Trap**
"Illustrate a regal album cover: AnLoMinus as a crowned DJ in renaissance robes, baroque gold filigree, stained-glass halos, dramatic chiaroscuro, painterly brushwork reminiscent of Adobe Fresco."

**3) Vaporwave Skyline**
"Craft a vaporwave banner: pastel sunset over a grid city, palm shadows, 90s UI widgets, VHS texture, minimal Japanese katakana for 'VisionLift', soft gradients and grain from Adobe Express."

**4) Futuristic Blueprint**
"Build a technical blueprint for a stage: wireframe speakers, hologram dancers, cyan on midnight background, numbered callouts, clean vector lines as if drawn in Illustrator with isometric guides."
